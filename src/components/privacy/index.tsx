A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Sites. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on your browser, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the Sites.
                      You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you reject the cookies on the Sites, you may still be able to use the Sites, but it shall be limited to certain minimal functionality. The only drawback to this is that you may be limited to some areas of Sites or limited to certain functions of the Sites.
